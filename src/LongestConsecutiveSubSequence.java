/*
Given an unsorted array of integers, we want to find the length of the longest subsequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers.
The consecutive numbers can be in any order.
Examples:
Input: [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20 , 2]
Output: 4
[1, 3, 4, 2] is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements.
 */
/*
UNDERSTAND:
Are there run time constraints?
Can extra memory be used?
What should we return if there is no subsequence with consecutive elements?
What should we return if there are duplicate elements in the subsequence?
What should we return for an empty array?
Run through a set of example cases:
